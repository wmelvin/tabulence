# Tabulence

**Tabulence** is a Firefox extension that lists the Title and URL for all browser tabs in the current window. The text in the extension's popup window is available for selecting, copying, and pasting into some other document.

There are buttons, in the popup window, to choose from the following formats:
- **Text** to paste into a plain text or wiki document.
- **Markdown** to paste into a `README.md` file, for example.
- **List Item** (`<a>` inside `<li>`) for pasting into a list in an HTML document.

**Note:** This Firefox extension is currently a learning project and personal utility. It is not packaged or published at `addons.mozilla.org`.
